    "An object is an instance of a class. A class is a blueprint or template that defines the attributes and behavior of a particular type of object.When we create an instance of a class, we create an object that has the same attributes and behavior as defined in the class.Each object has its own set of attributes, which are defined by the class. These attributes can be thought of as variables that are associated with the object.\n",

    "For Example:\n",
    "If we have a class called Person, we might define attributes like name, age, and gender. When we create an instance of the Person class, we create an object that has its own set of values for these attributes.\n",
    "In addition to attributes, objects also have behavior, which is defined by the methods of the class. "

    "\n",
    "1. Inheritance :-Inheritance is the process in which two classes have a relationship with each other, and objects of one class acquire properties and features of the other class. The class which inherits the features is known as the child class, and the class whose features it inherited is called the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Polymorphism :- The word polymorphism means having many forms. It is the ability to take more than one form. It is a feature that provides a function or an operator with more than one definition. It can be implemented using function overloading, operator overload, function overriding, virtual function. An operation may show off different behaviors at different times.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encapsulation:- In common terms, Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. In object-oriented programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstractiom :- Data abstraction refers to providing only necessary information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background info or implementation."

    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to create a new class based on an existing class. The new class, known as the derived class, inherits the attributes and methods of the existing class, known as the base class. This allows us to reuse code and build on existing functionality without having to start from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a mechanism of acquiring the features and behaviors of a class by another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOPs support the six different types of inheritance as given below :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single inheritance:- In single inheritance, a derived class inherits from a single base class. The derived class extends the functionality of the base class and can add its own attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example \n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",

    "dog = Dog(\"Fido\")\n",
    "print(dog.name)\n",
    "dog.make_sound()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multi-level inheritance:- In multilevel inheritance, a derived class inherits from a base class, which in turn inherits from another base class. The derived class extends the functionality of both base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example \n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal:\n",

In this type of inheritance, a single base class serves as a parent for multiple child classes, which inherit its attributes and methods. Each derived class can then have its own set of additional attributes and methods on top of what it inherits from the base class.\n",

    "6. Hybrid Inheritance :- Hybrid Inheritance is a combination of more than one type of inheritance in object-oriented programming. It involves the use of multiple inheritance (i.e., inheriting from more than one base class) and can also include the use of other types of inheritance such as single inheritance, multiple inheritance, hierarchical inheritance, etc. In other words, hybrid inheritance is a way of creating complex class hierarchies that combine the benefits of different types of inheritance.\n",
